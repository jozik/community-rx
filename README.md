**Abstract:** Cities are complex, dynamic, evolving adaptive systems comprised of people as well as interconnected physical infrastructure. Simulation modeling can help us understand and shape the evolution of our cities. In this paper, we describe an agent-based simulation modeling framework applied to Chicago, called chiSIM (for the Chicago Social Interaction Model). Each person residing in Chicago is represented as an agent in chiSIM; all places where people can be located in Chicago also are represented. The model simulates the movements of people between locations on an hourly basis during the course of a typical day. Co-located agents engage in various kinds of social interactions, such as exchanging information, engaging in business transactions, or simply sharing physical proximity. We discuss technical approaches to large-scale urban modeling including development of synthetic populations, efficiency gains through distributed processing, logging and analysis of simulation results, and visualization.

**Abstract:** We describe the development and application of a model that simulates the impact of CommunityRx, an information-based health intervention, on the utilization of community-based resources. The model includes a synthetic population of agents matching the sociodemographic characteristics of the South Side of Chicago, along with their activities and behaviors. We simulate the information-based intervention and model agent decision-making about using community resources to maintain health, based on a dynamic dosing of information about community resources, gained through interactions and experience. Through in silico experiments, our model aims to demonstrate the flow and spread of information from primary agents to others in the community, and through these dynamic interactions, the impact of an individual-level information intervention on resource utilization.
